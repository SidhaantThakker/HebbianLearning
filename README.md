# Welcome to my STDP project

### The full report documenting this code can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LVx6ue1dvXyi-UUpyUOkTHiS1Tj9LlZa--mDtyAG6HM/edit?usp=sharing)

### ANN-esque

This is my basic attempt at modelling what ahrdware absed attractor neural networks would function like, and what results we may expect

### PythonSTDPModel

These feature increasinly complex and sophisticated models for Python-based simulations for 
systems that function using Spike Timing Dependant Plasticity, built synchronously


### JavaSTDPModel

This is a large and highly tunable simulation model made in Java for completely asynchronous simulations
of STDP-based networks, with noise and error modelling.
